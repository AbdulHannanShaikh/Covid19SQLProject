# Covid19SQLProject

This is a project I undertook, utilizing a dataset from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths, which includes Covid-19 data for all countries. I conducted exploratory data analysis on the dataset, employing advanced SQL concepts such as subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Window functions, and Views.
